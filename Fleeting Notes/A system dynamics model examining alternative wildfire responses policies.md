"Furthermore, we explore policy resistance where excessive rates of high burn severity in the policy transition period lead to a reversion to fire exclusion policies." ([Thompson et al 2019:49](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IERWXR5S?page=1))

_This is cool!_

"Systems 2019, 7, 49 2 of 25 restrict the scale of implementation, such that treatments may be insucient to reduced hazard and risk [10-13]. Hence, the interest is in changing responses to wildfires in order to leverage natural fire as a force multiplier for landscape restoration eorts [" ([Thompson et al 2019:50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IERWXR5S?page=2))

"The distinguishing features of this study are the emphasis on wildfire response policy, a more thorough exploration of policy alternatives, and the design of dynamic rather than static policy scenarios." ([Thompson et al 2019:50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IERWXR5S?page=2))

_Its interesting that the policies are dynamic rather than static. I believe this is refering to the prior meantioned reversion if there are bad wildfires during the transition period_

"some ignitions to spread within proactively identified locations under acceptable conditions" ([Thompson et al 2019:51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IERWXR5S?page=3))

"To orient behavior in this system, we present a stylized causal loop diagram that distills the fire paradox into three primary elements: the burn rate, forest density, and burn severity (Figure 1). In this system, as the burn rate decreases (reflective of a fire exclusion management paradigm), forest density increases. As forest density increases, so too does burn severity. Specifically, the percentage of area burned at high severity may increase, even though the overall area burned may be lower due to the decrease in burn rate. As burn severity increases, forest density decreases, which creates a balancing loop. However, as the percentage of high-severity area burned increases, there is increasing sociopolitical pressure to emphasize fire exclusion and further reduce the burn rate to the extent possible. This creates a reinforcing feedback loop via management response, the outcomes of which are reflective of historical fire and forest management policies and the current condition of many dry forests in the western US."

"National Forest Service lands and their partners in Arizona, New Mexico, Washington, and Oregon will be nearing completion of initial strategic wildfire plans by the end of 2019" ([Thompson et al 2019:52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IERWXR5S?page=4))

_I'm pretty sure Thompson 2016 meantioned this as well. I should look into the outcome of this._

System dynamics models are generally defined by stocks (i.e., levels), flows (i.e., rates of transition in/out of stocks), and feedback loops. In this case, the stocks represent levels of each S-Class, flows represent successionand disturbance-driven S-Class transitions, and feedback loops emerge from stock-flow relationships following the basic dynamics illustrated in Figure 1 (although more complicated).
