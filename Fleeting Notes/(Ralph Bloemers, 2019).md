### Notes
Indiginous people used fire in complex ways to shape their livelihoods but central to that was the knowledge that larrge fires are not controlable. 

An approach to control fires: Clear ridgelines of vegitation to stop the spread of it. This is expensive and counter-intuitive.

Culture has distilled anti-fire beliefs through Smokey the Bear, Bambi, and WW2 propaganda. These ideas are not working because fire supression is leading to increased uncontrolled fires.

The process of many wildfires:

1. Fires start in mountains
2. Wind blows embers down toward homes
3. Embers enter through vents
4. Home burns from inside, out. This is hotter than an normal forest fire due to the synthetic materials in the structure.
5. In most cases, the flame front doesn't even touch the homes that are damaged in California wildfires
	1. There are solutons on a structural basis to help
		1. ember proof vents, hardening structures, buffer of trees around home
