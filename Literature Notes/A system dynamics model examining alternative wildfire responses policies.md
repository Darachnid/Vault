# A system dynamics model examining alternative wildfire responses policies

Author: [[Matthew Thompson]]
Year: 2019
Content Type: Publication

## 3 Quotes


## Notes
1. The [[System Dynamics Model]] developed by the authors examines the impact of wildfire response policy on the successional stage distributions of forests in the Southern Ponderosa Pine woodland ecosystem.
2. This model addresses the [[fire paradox]] by illustrasting its causes through a [[Causal Loop Diagram]] which contains a balancing and a reinforcing feedback loop with only three parameters: Forest Density, Burn Severity, and Burn Rate. The balancing loop follows that wildfire burn severity decreases the amount of fuel, thus lowering the density of the forest so that following forest fires are less severe. However, the Reinforcing feedback loop introduces "burn rate", a measure of the rate at which fires are allowed to burn as opposed to suppressing them, which decreases as the burn severity increases since more severe fires lead to higher concern for safety and thus higher suppression rates ![[Pasted image 20211006124013.png]]
3. This model utilizes dynamic policy parameters by allowing them to revert back to the status quo if the burn severity increases by a certain amount during the policy transition period
4. This model expands on a historical geo-spatial model on land cover as it relates to wildfires called [[LANDFIRE]]. 

## Author's Purpose

The authors purpose is to inform upcoming (as of 2019) policy decisions that relate to wildfires in the Western United States.

## Strengths

- Dynamic policy parameters allow for realistic responses to policy implimentation, specifically the reversion of policies given increased wildfire intensity during the transition period of the policy.
- The causal loop diagram is very simple. It has only three paarameters.
- The outputs of the model are ecologically and socially relevant since they include successional stage distributions of forests, as well as other more anthropocentric results.
